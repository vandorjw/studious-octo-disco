Hi,

I started to write in C. The last program I wrote in C was over 5 years ago.
String manipulation in C sucks. Having to think about what is a pointer, and what is not, sucks.

C has its place, in embeded hardware, where nothing else is available.
Today I watched a video presentation on low latency Java, and real-time programming.

The requirements can dictate the language used. No need to re-invent the wheel and use C to write a web-backend application.
